7.1 DIELECTRIC MATERIALS

A dielectric material typically is a large-bandgap semiconductor (E3 ~ >4 eV) that exhibits high
resistivity (p). The prex dia means through in the Greek language. The word dielectric refers to a
material that normally does not allow electricity (electrons, ions, and so on) to pass through it. There
are special situations (for example, exposure to very high electric elds or changes in the composi-
tion or microstructure) that may lead to a dielectric material exhibiting semiconducting or metallic
behavior. However, when theterm dielectric material is used, it generally is understood that the

material essentially is a nonconductor of electricity. An electrical insulator is a dielectric material
that exhibits a high breakdown eld.

7.1.1 ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION

To better understand the behavior of nonconducting materials, let us first examine the concept of
electrostatic induction and what is meant by the terms free charge and bound charge, First, con-
sider a dielectric such as a typical ceramic or a plastic that has a net ositive charge on its surface,
Now, assume that we bring a Conductor B near this charged Insulator A {Figure 7.13). The electric
field associated with the positively charged Insulator A pulls the electrons toward it from Conducto;

B. This is also described as the atoms in Conductor B being polarized or affected by the pgesence
of an electric field.
